### Hallo 👋

📐 My name is Chloe and I'm a software developer. I'm passionate about creating software that serves the greater good by incorporating mathematical concepts to provide insightful analysis.

🔭 I’m currently looking for work in software and data engineering.
🧠 I’m currently learning SAS and the ANOVA statstical model to strengthen my data analysis skill set.
🌎 I'm currently practicing my Spanish skills to become conversational.

☕ "I speak java" : This is my motto, as I'm an avid lover of coffee and Java was my first programming language.
